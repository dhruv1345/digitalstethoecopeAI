# Mboathoscope

The high cost of stethoscopes is a major obstacle for healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries, where affordable options are limited. Cheap stethoscopes are often used, but they are hard to sterilize and wear out quickly, resulting in cross-contamination and increased physical contact with patients.

**Mboathoscope** is an open source digital stethoscope AI app that allows users to record, visualize and analyze heart and lung sounds. It uses machine learning algorithms to provide insights into the audio data and aid in the diagnosis of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

## Features

 - Record heart and lung sounds using the smartphone's built-in microphone.
 - Visualize recorded audio data in the time domain and frequency domain.
 - Analyze audio data using machine learning algorithms to identify heart and lung abnormalities.
